# Simple URL Shortener

This project is a simple url shortener that I use to share certains link, as some public Notion pages.

There is no database, as all routes are hardcoded. Maybe in the future I will create a fancier version linking it to a DB and adding more features.

It is deployed in https://go.rubenvillar.net and you can test a few links:
